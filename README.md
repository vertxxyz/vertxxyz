### Unity Troubleshooting
I maintain a website for troubleshooting basic Unity issues often asked on the Unity Discord [here](https://unity.huh.how).  
It can be contributed to [here](https://github.com/vertxxyz/help.vertx.xyz).  

### Developer Notes
I developed and curate [Developer Notes](https://github.com/Developer-Notes-Extension) ðŸ’¬, a browser extension that displays shared comments on gamedev documentation. There have been hundreds of notes contributed, a significant portion of which are my own.

### Discord
I moderate the [Unity Discord](https://discord.gg/unity) and am developing helper tools to maintain its resources and enhance its moderation.
