### Unity Utilities
- [NSelection](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NSelection)
Select Objects behind others in the scene-view hassle-free.
- [Utilities](https://github.com/vertxxyz/Vertx.Utilities)
A core package that contains many resources I use daily. This is required to allow the below packages to function.
  - [Debugging](https://github.com/vertxxyz/Vertx.Debugging)
  Utilities for debugging physics cast methods in the same format as Unity's Debug functions
  - [Attributes](https://github.com/vertxxyz/Vertx.Attributes)
  Property Attributes and Drawers I use daily.
  - [Editors](https://github.com/vertxxyz/Vertx.Editors)
  Extensions to Unity's built-in editors that add basic navigation improvements. Easily find other scriptable objects of similar types, select assets from scripts, all in an extremely built-in feeling manner.
- [Monospaced Console](https://github.com/vertxxyz/Monospaced-Console)
Ever printed a 2D array and Unity displays it wonky and jagged? Problem solved.
